= GraphQL Forum

IMPORTANT: DO NOT even think about using this in production, lest your sanity be destroyed and credentials lost!

Loosely following the awesome book _Zero to Production In Rust_, minus the vigorous test cases and battle tested framework.

== TL;DR

Summarize backend in one line?::
Good performance without even trying, massive pain keeping SQL and code in sync, and huge trouble working around corners of API.

Summarize frontend in one line?::
Surprisingly pleasant to write, but documentation is scarce, and code size is large. 
WASM is probably not ready to be the "main site" yet.

Comment the code quality?::
It would be an excellent playground to practice exploits!

How was the experience?::
Extremely determined. Damn, full-stack is hard.

Will I do this again?::
No, not the full stack. If I want to build _anything_ for real, I would go for something like Preact (for frontend) + Hasura (for GQL and data) + Ory Kratos (for auth). For other backend services that don't involve dealing with data store, I would still consider Rust Axum, tower stack, and `async-graphql` to be good.

How is the code quality?::
TheDailyWTF kind of quality.

== Building and running

Make sure you have link:https://github.com/thedodd/trunk[trunk] installed.

Go to `gqlforum-sycamore/`, then:

....
$ trunk build --release
....

Go to `gqlforum-backend/`, then:

....
$ cargo run --release
....

Go to http://localhost:3000 for the main page.
Go to http://localhost:3000/graphql for GraphQL playground.

Admin account is `admin`, password is `admin`.

The configs in `configuration.toml` should be apparent.

== Features

=== The Stack

Backend::
* `async-graphql`
* Axum
* Tower
* `sqlx`
* SQLite

Frontend::
* Sycamore
* WASM

=== Backend Functionality

* [x] Serves a frontend with the same server
* [x] Backend with tracing
* [x] List topics
* [x] Topic by id
* [x] Create topic
* [x] Create post
* [x] Delete topic
* [x] Delete post

== Frontend Functionality

* [x] Login page
* [x] Logout link
* [x] List topics
* [x] Topic by id
* [x] Create topic
* [x] Create post
* [ ] [.line-through]#Delete topic#
* [ ] [.line-through]#Delete post#

=== Authentication

* [x] Server side session management
** [x] Signed secure cookie on client side, hashed secret on server side
* [x] Password authentication with Argon2
* [x] Login via username/password
* [x] Registration (GraphQL only)
* [x] Change password

=== Authorization

* [x] Only admins/author can see deleted topics and posts
* [x] Regular users can see their own posts/topics and any public posts/topics
* [x] Regular users can only delete their own posts
* [x] Admin can delete every post

=== Anti-features

* [x] No HTTPS. Therefore, **credentials are sent in clear text**
** Admittedly, this is easy to fix.
* [x] Frontend crashes all the time. Try refreshing
* [x] Horrendous UI design
* [x] Despite the backend can paginate, you can only see the latest 10 topics on index page
* [x] Despite the backend has this API, you cannot see user profiles at frontend
* [x] Despite the backend has this API, you cannot register at frontend
* [x] Despite the backend has this API, you cannot delete posts or topics at frontend
* [x] Terrible error messages
* [x] `panic!`, `unwrap`, and `expect` everywhere
* [x] Error handling scattered across front end, backend, on different layers of `Result`/`Option`, etc.
* [x] Barely any defenses
* [x] No checks what so ever in user input, but injection is guarded against
* [x] Spaghetti code scattered around like crazy
* [x] No documentation, no tests, no examples
* [x] Monolith repo
* [x] A test page that does no good except to verify my graphql implementation
* [x] Stale sessions are not cleaned up regularly
* [x] Random crashes if redirection goes too quickly

== Design Choices

=== N+1

N+1 is not purposefully avoided.
Joins are used to ensure correctness and access control, but not for performance (yet).
See: https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html.

=== Access Control

Metadata consistency and access control are ensured on SQL queries instead of at application level.
Access control comes in form of 4 views: `topic_permissions`, `topic_public`, `post_permissions`, and `post_public`.

=== Invariants

* Posts are never deleted from database.
* Post number is never changed.
* Post metadata is always accessible, but contents can only be viewed as permitted.

These invariants are enforced by the SQL query used to access posts.

== Experience Report

WARNING: DO NOT IMPLEMENT PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION AND SESSIONS YOURSELF!

=== The Good

* Great performance without even trying
** While I don't have much web experience, the backend feels exceptionally fast
** With `--release`, that is
** 12MB memory use? Yeah, pretty good.
* Axum comes with a great collection of middleware
* `async-graphql` object definition is relatively easy to use... once I got the basics
** I will continue to use it if I need to write a service to _do something_ instead of to _retrieve something_. The latter is better done with existing solution, like Hasura
* The compiler is very good at catching mistakes, if I am actually using types properly
* Trunk sets up WASM output nicely

=== The Bad

General::
* I have to keep the frontend/backend router in sync, manually.
** For every route the SPA uses, I need the backend to serve the `index.html`
* Cargo workspace does not work well with mixed targets
* There are these... "Context" paradigm which does something like `get_context::<Type>()` which I don't like, because they destroy the point of having a statically type-checked language. And they are everywhere.

Backend::
* Really, we are manually doing monad stack here by using all those `Context<'_'>`, `Extension`, `Layer`, ... except without the nice `do` syntax Haskell provides
* `async-graphql` doesn't work very well with Axum middleware
** Cannot use `CookieJar` because we cannot return extra arguments
*** Ended up rolling my own implementation to sign cookies
** Repetition in binding middleware (in Axum and `async-graphql`)
* `sqlx` generics are extremely hard to type check, but I managed to use some anyways
* `sqlx` macros do not work well with SQLite, because it type checks SQLite bytecode at compile time. This has some bugs, and is an extremely slow process

Frontend::
* There aren't any Rust GraphQL clients that work under WASM, so I rolled a simple one in a single file.
* Trunk's proxy doesn't work. It just keeps redirecting until the browser refuses to continue.
* Took me an enormous amount of time to figure out how to do async in WASM
* Sycamore doesn't have very good docs. I hacked around with terrible looking code.
* Sycamore macros don't work well with formatting
* Sycamore's routing seems a bit limited
* Cannot figure out how to set status code for Sycamore
* Fight the borrow checker with loads of `.as_ref()` and `.clone()`
* Wasm is quite large, compared to JS libraries. I have practically all optimization turned to max in this project, and the size is still 327kB/129kB(gzipped). Also, it grows fast.

== Conclusion

It started with me trying to make a small, monolith, self-contained forum that can run on extremely resource-limited machines.
Then my sanity drained as I went along, and I cut features over and over, until I decide "this is going to be a technological study".

_No, I will not continue developing this pile of diamonds_.
If I really want one in production, I am going for something else.

I do, however, think that this "full-stack" project contains some insights on the current ecosystem of Rust in web development, and some snippets that _might_ be helpful to someone else.

Just don't deploy it in production.
